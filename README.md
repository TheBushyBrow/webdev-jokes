# webdev-jokes
A small but growing collection of web development jokes by [@jerstew](http://jerstew.com).

These jokes originated in conversations with fellow developers, were tweeted at various times, and were finally compiled into a list and a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@jerstew/web-development-jokes-d97bc7c8891b). It seemed the best way to continue the documentation was through a git repository.
